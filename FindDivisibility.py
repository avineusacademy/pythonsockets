### This program is to find if given number is divisible by 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9

num = int(input('Enter number to test divisibility with numbers '))

## Check divisibility by 2
if ((num %  2) == 0):
    print('Given number', str(num), 'Is Divisible by 2')
else:
    print('Given number', str(num), 'Is not Divisible by 2')

## Check divisibility by 3
if ((num % 3) == 0):
    print('Given number', str(num), 'Is Divisible by 3')
else:
    print('Given number', str(num), 'Is not Divisible by 3')

## Check divisibility by 4
if ((num % 4) == 0):
    print('Given number', str(num), 'Is Divisible by 4')
else:
    print('Given number', str(num), 'Is not Divisible by 4')

## Check divisibility by 5
if ((num % 5) == 0):
    print('Given number', str(num), 'Is Divisible by 5')
else:
    print('Given number', str(num), 'Is not Divisible by 5')

## Check divisibility by 6
if ((num % 6) == 0):
    print('Given number', str(num), 'Is Divisible by 6')
else:
    print('Given number', str(num), 'Is not Divisible by 6')

## Check divisibility by 7
if ((num % 7) == 0):
    print('Given number', str(num), 'Is Divisible by 7')
else:
    print('Given number', str(num), 'Is not Divisible by 7')

## Check divisibility by 8
if ((num % 8) == 0):
    print('Given number', str(num), 'Is Divisible by 8')
else:
    print('Given number', str(num), 'Is not Divisible by 8')

## Check divisibility by 9
if ((num % 9) == 0):
    print('Given number', str(num), 'Is Divisible by 9')
else:
    print('Given number', str(num), 'Is not Divisible by 9')
